                            <p className="text-gray-700 leading-relaxed mb-4">If you keep it too practical, it might feel dull. But if you go too stylish, it might get impossible to keep up with it. The sweet spot lies somewhere in between, where function meets design without making everyday life harder.</p>
                            <p className="text-gray-700 leading-relaxed mb-4">It&#39;s no surprise that people who want functional yet stylish kitchens turn to the best interior design in Bangalore, with Hub Interior leading the way.</p>

                        {/* Trend 1: Smart L-Shaped Kitchen */}
                        <div className="space-y-3 text-gray-700 leading-relaxed mb-8">
                            <h3 className="text-xl font-semibold text-gray-900">Smart L-Shaped Kitchen</h3>
                            <p>In most of the houses, the kitchen space is always the one that gets compromised. The reason why our customers at HUB Interior love the L-shaped kitchens. Not only does this save space, but it also creates a kitchen work triangle (sink, stove, fridge) that makes cooking prep easy.</p>
                            <p>The good part is that it works in both small and medium kitchens. Plus, you get enough open space. Just a tip: keep the open area facing the living or dining area to make the kitchen look bigger.</p>
                            <div className="relative w-full h-72 md:h-96 rounded-xl overflow-hidden">
                                <img src="/Lshapekitchen.png" alt="L-shaped kitchen layout" className="w-full h-full object-cover" />
                            </div>
                        </div>

                        {/* Trend 2: Add a Pop of Color */}
                        <div className="space-y-3 text-gray-700 leading-relaxed mb-8">
                            <h3 className="text-xl font-semibold text-gray-900">Add a Pop of Color</h3>
                            <p>If you&#39;re bored with beige, black, white, or neutral-colored kitchens, you have to try this! Adding a pop of color to your kitchen interior design is a great way to bring more attention to your kitchen. If you don't want to go overboard, start with a small space, maybe a cabinet or a drawer, but differentiate it with a unique, popping color.</p>
                            <p>Firstly, it draws a visual interest by being a focal point creation, and secondly, it works as a mood enhancer (plus, it&#39;s easy to update or change in case you want a new look later). A quick tip: try adding a pop of color on design elements like handles, a shelf, a middle cabinet, or rounded cabinets.</p>
                            <div className="relative w-full h-72 md:h-96 rounded-xl overflow-hidden">
                                <img src="/kb2.png" alt="Kitchen with a pop of color" className="w-full h-full object-cover" />

                            <h3 className="text-xl font-semibold text-gray-900">Go For Curved Cabinets</h3>
                            <p>If you&#39;re not a fan of boxy cabinets, curved cabinets will definitely be your favorite. On top of that, it&#39;s safe for children, as it doesn&#39;t have any sharp edges or corners, which reduces the chances of bumps and accidents, especially if the kitchen space is small.</p>
                            <p>Additionally, it adds a contemporary interior design look that guides the eye and improves the kitchen flow, making the space look bigger.</p>
                            <div className="relative w-full h-72 md:h-96 rounded-xl overflow-hidden">

                        <div className="space-y-3 text-gray-700 leading-relaxed mb-8">
                            <h3 className="text-xl font-semibold text-gray-900">Try Golden Hardware</h3>
                            <p>It&#39;s not a secret that gold is a trendsetter. If you're looking for an easy-to-follow trend that looks chic and adds luxury to your kitchen without you spending lakhs and lakhs on it, try out the golden hardware trend.</p>
                            <p>Change the boring silver hardware to golden ones, be it your handles, knobs, or faucets. And the best part? It goes beautifully with any color, be it white, green, navy, or even black.</p>
                            <div className="relative w-full h-72 md:h-96 rounded-xl overflow-hidden">

                            <h3 className="text-xl font-semibold text-gray-900">Utilize Multipurpose Nooks</h3>
                            <p>If you have a little space left in your kitchen and you have no idea what to do, create a multipurpose nook by adding a small corner bench or shelf that doubles as seating or a workspace. You can also use it as a breakfast nook, coffee station, or mini bar.</p>
                            <p>If done right, these nooks add a touch of personality, making the kitchen look unique and curated. A bonus tip: add hidden compartments to double it as storage.</p>
                            <div className="relative w-full h-72 md:h-96 rounded-xl overflow-hidden">

                            <h3 className="text-xl font-semibold text-gray-900">Design Toe-Kick Drawers</h3>
                            <p>The lowest part of cabinets, called the toe-kick, isn&#39;t just support; it can be functional too. Add hidden pull-out drawers under cabinets for extra, out-of-sight storage. It works perfectly for small kitchens where you need more storage space.</p>
                            <p>Since it's fully hidden, it doesn't disturb your overall kitchen look, maintaining the interior design.</p>
                            <div className="relative w-full h-72 md:h-96 rounded-xl overflow-hidden">

                            <p>For food lovers and daily kitchen users, whether you rely on a blender, mixer, toaster, waffle maker, or can&#39;t start the day without your coffee maker or electric kettle, an appliance garage is a smart and stylish solution for kitchen interior design. It offers a clutter-free counter, keeping the appliance out of sight and inside a hidden door.</p>
                            <p>Additionally, it protects them from dust, grease, or any kitchen dirt, so you don't have to clean it every now and then. A bonus tip: Include pull-outs or built-in outlets for convenience of use.</p>
                            <div className="relative w-full h-72 md:h-96 rounded-xl overflow-hidden">
