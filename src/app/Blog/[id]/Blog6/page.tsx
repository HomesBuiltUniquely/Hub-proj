                            <h2 className="text-2xl font-bold text-gray-900 pt-4">Step 1: Analyse Your Kitchen Habits</h2>
                            <p>Before you plan layouts or choose finishes, look closely at how the kitchen is used every day. Think about:</p>
                            
                            <div className="bg-gray-50 p-6 rounded-lg mt-4">
                                <ul className="space-y-2">
                                    <li>How often you cook and for how many people.</li>
                                    <li>Whether the kitchen doubles as a breakfast, coffee, or casual dining area.</li>
                                    <li>The storage you actually need for utensils, groceries, and appliances.</li>
                                </ul>
                            </div>
                            
                            <p>Understanding your routine ensures the kitchen is designed around your life, rather than forcing you to adapt to the space. Proper planning at this stage sets the foundation for a kitchen interior in Bengaluru that works seamlessly.</p>
                            
                            <h2 className="text-2xl font-bold text-gray-900 pt-6">Step 2: Plan the Layout for Effortless Flow</h2>
                            <div className="relative w-full h-72 md:h-96 rounded-xl overflow-hidden mt-3">
                                <img src="/Ukitchen.png" alt="Kitchen layout design" className="w-full h-full object-cover" />
                            </div>
                            <p>Movement in the kitchen should feel natural. Consider separating zones for cooking, prep, and socialising. A smart layout saves time and reduces frustration, even in small spaces.</p>
                            
                            <div className="bg-gray-50 p-6 rounded-lg mt-4">
                                <h3 className="text-lg font-semibold text-gray-900 mb-3">Tips for an efficient layout:</h3>
                                <ul className="space-y-2">
                                    <li>Keep the sink, stove, and fridge within an ergonomic triangle.</li>
                                    <li>Create a prep area with easy access to knives, cutting boards, and ingredients.</li>
                                    <li>Designate a breakfast or coffee corner to keep the cooking zone free.</li>
                                </ul>
                            </div>
                            
                            <p>Planning the layout carefully ensures the kitchen supports both work and interaction, making it a hub of the home.</p>

                            <h2 className="text-2xl font-bold text-gray-900 pt-6">Step 3: Choose Durable Materials with Style</h2>
                            <div className="relative w-full h-72 md:h-96 rounded-xl overflow-hidden mt-3">
                                <img src="/straightkitchen.png" alt="Kitchen materials" className="w-full h-full object-cover" />
                            </div>
                            <p>Material choice affects both usability and appearance. For modern kitchen interior designs, opt for surfaces that are long-lasting, easy to clean, and visually appealing.</p>
                            
                            <div className="bg-gray-50 p-6 rounded-lg mt-4">
                                <ul className="space-y-2">
                                    <li><strong>Quartz or engineered stone</strong> for countertops that resist stains and scratches.</li>
                                    <li><strong>Laminates</strong> for cabinets that provide a sleek finish without maintenance worries.</li>
                                    <li><strong>Glass-front cabinets</strong> to reflect light and create a sense of space.</li>
                                </ul>
                            </div>

                            <p>Combining textures such as wood, stone, and metal adds visual depth, while maintaining a contemporary kitchen interior design that looks polished yet practical.</p>

                            <h2 className="text-2xl font-bold text-gray-900 pt-6">Step 4: Maximise Storage with Modular Solutions</h2>
                            <div className="relative w-full h-72 md:h-96 rounded-xl overflow-hidden mt-3">
                                <img src="/Lshapekitchen.png" alt="Modular kitchen storage" className="w-full h-full object-cover" />
                            </div>
                            <p>Storage plays a key role in a well-designed kitchen. A modular kitchen interior in Bengaluru allows you to organise everything efficiently while keeping counters clear.</p>
                            
                            <div className="bg-gray-50 p-6 rounded-lg mt-4">
                                <h3 className="text-lg font-semibold text-gray-900 mb-3">Creative storage solutions include:</h3>
                                <ul className="space-y-2">
                                    <li>Pull-out drawers for spices, utensils, and cutlery.</li>
                                    <li>Rotating corner carousels for hard-to-reach items.</li>
                                    <li>Tall cabinets to use vertical space effectively.</li>
                                    <li>Pantry units for groceries, appliances, and bulk items.</li>
                                </ul>
                            </div>
                            
                            <p>Efficient storage ensures everything has a place, making cooking and cleaning faster and less stressful. Modular solutions also adapt to changing needs, from small apartments to large luxury kitchens.</p>

                            <h2 className="text-2xl font-bold text-gray-900 pt-6">Step 5: Layer Lighting and Ventilation</h2>
                            <p>Good lighting changes how a kitchen feels and works. Combine different types of light to create a balanced, inviting space.</p>
                            
                            <div className="bg-gray-50 p-6 rounded-lg mt-4">
                                <h3 className="text-lg font-semibold text-gray-900 mb-3">Effective lighting ideas:</h3>
                                <ul className="space-y-2">
                                    <li>Task lighting under cabinets to illuminate counters.</li>
                                    <li>Ceiling lights for overall brightness.</li>
                                    <li>Accent lighting for shelves, islands, or decorative areas.</li>
                                </ul>
                            </div>

                            <p>Proper ventilation is equally important to remove smoke, odours, and moisture. Well-planned lighting design ideas and airflow make the kitchen feel airy, clean, and comfortable.</p>

                            <h2 className="text-2xl font-bold text-gray-900 pt-6">Step 6: Design for Interaction</h2>
                            <div className="relative w-full h-72 md:h-96 rounded-xl overflow-hidden mt-3">
                                <img src="/parallelkitchen.png" alt="Interactive kitchen design" className="w-full h-full object-cover" />
                            </div>
                            <p>Modern kitchens are social spaces that work efficiently. Open layouts, islands, and seating zones allow cooking to happen alongside conversations and shared moments.</p>
                            
                            <div className="bg-gray-50 p-6 rounded-lg mt-4">
                                <ul className="space-y-2">
                                    <li>Add a breakfast bar or window seating for casual meals.</li>
                                    <li>Include space for children or family members to engage without disrupting cooking.</li>
                                    <li>Create visual continuity with the living or dining area for a connected feel.</li>
                                </ul>
                            </div>

                            <p>Designing for interaction turns the kitchen into a lively and inviting space without compromising its practicality.</p>

                            <h2 className="text-2xl font-bold text-gray-900 pt-6">Step 7: Integrate Functional and Stylish Features</h2>
                            <div className="relative w-full h-72 md:h-96 rounded-xl overflow-hidden mt-3">

                            <p>Functionality doesn&#39;t have to be boring. Stylish kitchen interior solutions make storage, appliances, and work surfaces both practical and visually appealing.</p>
                            
                            <div className="bg-gray-50 p-6 rounded-lg mt-4">

                                    <li>Pull-out spice racks, hidden drawers, and multi-tiered storage.</li>
                                    <li>Kitchen islands that double as prep space and casual seating.</li>
                                    <li>Integrated appliances for a sleek, uncluttered look.</li>
                                    <li>Statement backsplashes or lighting accents for visual interest.</li>
                                </ul>
                            </div>
