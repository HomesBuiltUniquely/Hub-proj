When it comes to interior design, wardrobes are often treated as purely storage, a place where we can store our clothes, shoes, and accessories, and maybe a few things we don&#39;t even remember we own.</p>
                            <p className="text-gray-700 leading-relaxed mb-4">At <span className="font-black text-black">HUB Interior, Bangalore</span>, we see wardrobes DIFFERENTLY. For years, we&#39;ve been helping our clients turn these everyday spaces into statement pieces. Functional, yes, but also clever problem-solving spaces that make life a little easier (and a lot more stylish).</p>
                            <p className="text-gray-700 leading-relaxed mb-8">And we&#39;re here to help you out! Below are 7 wardrobe design ideas that you should definitely check out. We promise they&#39;ll make you rethink how you organize and interact with your clothes and accessories.</p>

                            <p>Plus, they add a modern, high-end touch to your wardrobe layout.

                            <h2 className="text-2xl font-bold text-gray-900 pt-6">Push-to-Open Wardrobe</h2>
                            <p>If you&#39;re someone who wants to go minimal with no handles, push-to-open wardrobe design is a must-try. With this smart mechanism, you simply have to press on the door, and it opens without the use of a handle.</p>
                            <p>It is great for smaller rooms and even luxury apartments where you don&#39;t want to add many elements. This creates a sleek visual line along with making your wardrobe more ergonomic and easy to use for convenience. You can customize it with wood, lacquer, or mirrored finishes, creating a wardrobe that&#39;s not just storage but a design statement.</p>

                            <h2 className="text-2xl font-bold text-gray-900 pt-6">Glow-Up Your Wardrobe with LEDs</h2>
                            <p>Lighting isn&#39;t just for the room. It can make your wardrobe shine too! Ask your interior designers to add integrated LED strips in your wardrobe while building it to highlight your clothes, bags, and accessories, making it easier to pick the outfit, even in low light.</p>
                            <p>A quick tip: Go with the ones that provide adjustable brightness and even color options to make it a functional design element that makes your wardrobe stand out.</p>

                            <h2 className="text-2xl font-bold text-gray-900 pt-6">Translucent Glass Wardrobe Doors</h2>
                            <p>Instead of going with the basic wardrobe door, go with a translucent glass wardrobe door. This 2026 wardrobe trend lets light filter through while keeping your clothes and accessories subtly hidden, creating a perfect balance between privacy and display. Whether frosted, tinted, or patterned, translucent glass doors work with any setting.</p>
                            <p>If possible, ask your interior designer to match it with a push-to-open mechanism to create a minimal design. Interior designers love these doors for their ability to make spaces feel larger and brighter, especially in smaller rooms.</p>
                            
                            <div className="relative w-[580px] h-[580px] md:h-105 rounded-xl overflow-hidden mt-3 ml-30">

                            <h2 className="text-2xl font-bold text-gray-900 pt-6">Pull Out Hanging Rods</h2>
                            <p>Maximize vertical wardrobe space with pull-down hanging rods to access clothes kept in upper sections without using a stool. It's practical, space-saving, and time-saving, making tall wardrobes fully usable while keeping everything organized. We at <span className="font-black text-black">HUB Interior</span> love incorporating these rods into tall or compact wardrobes to add additional space without sacrificing our client&#39;s style.</p>
                            <p>Plus, it can be combined with any finish, be it wooden, mirrored, gloss, or matte laminate. It&#39;s a small (yet big) addition that makes your wardrobe more ergonomic, accessible, and visually appealing.</p>

                            <p>Who says your wardrobe is just for clothes? You can integrate a seating area in your wardrobe to use it while trying on shoes, folding outfits, or just wondering what you should wear next.</p>
                            <p>You can also add drawers or small pull-out shelves for accessories underneath the seating bench to make it match the overall aesthetics while using it as storage. It&#39;s all about blending function with fun.</p>
                            
                            <div className="relative w-[580px] h-[580px] md:h-105 rounded-xl overflow-hidden mt-3 ml-30">
