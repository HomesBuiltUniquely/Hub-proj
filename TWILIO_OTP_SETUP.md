# Twilio OTP Implementation for Landing Page

## Overview
This project now uses Twilio SMS service for OTP verification instead of Firebase. The implementation includes:

- **Send OTP API**: `/api/send-twilio-otp` - Sends OTP via SMS
- **Verify OTP API**: `/api/verify-twilio-otp` - Verifies the entered OTP
- **Updated Landing Page**: `LandingPage1/HeroSection.tsx` - Now uses Twilio OTP

## Setup Instructions

### 1. Twilio Account Setup
1. Sign up for a Twilio account at [twilio.com](https://twilio.com)
2. Get your Account SID and Auth Token from the Twilio Console
3. Purchase a phone number for sending SMS (or use trial number for testing)

### 2. Environment Variables
Create a `.env.local` file in your project root with:

```env
# Twilio Configuration
TWILIO_ACCOUNT_SID=your_twilio_account_sid_here
TWILIO_AUTH_TOKEN=your_twilio_auth_token_here
TWILIO_PHONE_NUMBER=your_twilio_phone_number_here

# Gmail Configuration (for sending emails)
GMAIL_USER=your_gmail_address@gmail.com
GMAIL_PASS=your_gmail_app_password_here
```

### 3. Dependencies
The project now includes:
- `twilio` - For SMS functionality
- `nodemailer` - For email functionality (already present)

## How It Works

### OTP Flow
1. User fills out the landing page form
2. Form submits immediately as "Unverified User"
3. OTP modal appears asking for phone verification
4. User clicks "Send OTP" â†’ API calls `/api/send-twilio-otp`
5. Twilio sends SMS with 6-digit OTP
6. User enters OTP and clicks "Verify OTP"
7. API calls `/api/verify-twilio-otp` to verify
8. If successful, form resubmits as "Verified User"

### Security Features
- OTP expires after 5 minutes
- Maximum 3 failed attempts allowed
- OTP is stored in memory (for production, use Redis/database)
- Phone number validation and formatting

### API Endpoints

#### POST `/api/send-twilio-otp`
**Request Body:**
```json
{
  "phone": "+919876543210"
}
```

**Response:**
```json
{
  "success": true,
  "message": "OTP sent successfully",
  "sid": "SM1234567890abcdef"
}
```

#### POST `/api/verify-twilio-otp`
**Request Body:**
```json
{
  "phone": "+919876543210",
  "otp": "123456"
}
```

**Response:**
```json
{
  "success": true,
  "message": "OTP verified successfully"
}
```

## Testing

### 1. Local Development
1. Set up environment variables
2. Run `npm run dev`
3. Test the landing page form
4. Check console logs for API responses

### 2. Twilio Trial Limitations
- Trial accounts can only send SMS to verified numbers
- Add your phone number to verified numbers in Twilio Console
- Limited SMS quota for trial accounts

## Production Considerations

### 1. OTP Storage
Current implementation uses in-memory storage. For production:
- Use Redis for OTP storage
- Implement proper session management
- Add rate limiting per phone number

### 2. Error Handling
- Add proper logging for production
- Implement retry mechanisms
- Add monitoring for failed SMS deliveries

### 3. Cost Optimization
- Monitor SMS usage and costs
- Consider implementing OTP expiration notifications
- Add analytics for OTP success/failure rates

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

1. **"SMS service not configured"**
   - Check environment variables are set correctly
   - Verify Twilio credentials

2. **"Invalid phone number format"**
   - Ensure phone number includes country code (+91 for India)
   - Check phone number validation logic

3. **"OTP has expired"**
   - OTP expires after 5 minutes
   - User needs to request new OTP

4. **"Too many failed attempts"**
   - User exceeded 3 failed attempts
   - Need to request new OTP

### Debug Steps
1. Check browser console for errors
2. Verify API endpoints are accessible
3. Check Twilio Console for SMS delivery status
4. Verify environment variables in `.env.local`

## Migration from Firebase

### What Was Removed
- Firebase authentication imports
- reCAPTCHA implementation
- Firebase config file
- Firebase-related state variables

### What Was Added
- Twilio SMS integration
- New OTP verification flow
- Simplified OTP modal (no reCAPTCHA)
- Better error handling for SMS failures
